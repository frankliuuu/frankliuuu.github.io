          Hey! I'm Frank Liu, a third-year computer science student at Princeton
          University with plans on minoring in statistics and machine learning,
          originally from Atlanta, Georgia. <br /> <br />
          Iâ€™m passionate about using technology to create interactive and
          engaging experiences, especially when it comes to learning. I am
          always looking for ways to gamify everyday experiences with my skills
          of full-stack development. <br /> <br />
          Beyond coding, you'll find me thrifting, rock climbing, and playing
          video games!
        </p>

    </section>
